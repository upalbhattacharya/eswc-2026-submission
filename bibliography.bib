We explore an approach with three steps: edge search which is to find a set of candidate locations to insert (i.e., subsumptions between concepts), edge formation and enrichment which leverages the ontological structure to produce and enhance the edge candidates, and edge selection which eventually locates the edge to be placed into. In all steps, we propose to leverage neural methods, where we apply embedding-based methods and contrastive learning with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT for edge search, and adapt a BERT fine-tuning-based multi-label Edge-Cross-encoder, and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT series, FLAN-T5, and Llama 2, for edge selection. We evaluate the methods on recent datasets created using the SNOMED CT ontology and the MedMentions entity linking benchmark. The best settings in our framework use fine-tuned PLM for search and a multi-label Cross-encoder for selection. Zero-shot prompting of LLMs is still not adequate for the task, and we propose explainable instruction tuning of LLMs for improved performance. Our study shows the advantages of PLMs and highlights the encouraging performance of LLMs that motivates future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Ontologies are crucial for integrating and reasoning with data from diverse sources. Engineering a domain ontology for SAR can be better supported from an agile, collaborative, and iterative ontology engineering methodology (OEM), incorporating the interests of several stakeholders. Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a significant role in completing OEM processes. The goal of this work is to identify how ontology engineering (OE) tasks can be completed with the collaboration of LLMs and humans. The objectives of this paper are, a) to present preliminary exploration of LLMs to generate domain ontologies for the modeling of SAR missions in wildfire incidents b) to propose and evaluate an LLM-enhanced OE approach. In overall, the main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the analysis of LLMs capabilities to ontology engineering, and the evaluation of the synergy between humans and machines to efficiently represent knowledge, with specific focus in the SAR domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = "This study proposes a method to evaluate the capability of large language models (LLMs) in identifying lexical semantic equivalence. The Word-in-Context (WiC) task, a benchmark designed to determine whether the meanings of a target word remain identical across different contexts, is employed as a probing task. Experiments are conducted with several LLMs, including proprietary GPT models and open-source models, using zero-shot prompting with adjectives that represent varying levels of semantic equivalence (e.g., ``the same'') or inequivalence (e.g., ``different''). The fundamental capability to identify lexical semantic equivalence in context is measured using standard accuracy metrics. Consistency across different levels of semantic equivalence is assessed via rank correlation with the expected canonical ranking of precision and recall, reflecting anticipated trends in performance across prompts. The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness, highlighting the superior capability of GPT-4o, as it consistently outperforms other explored LLMs. Analysis of the WiC dataset, the discriminative properties of adjectives (i.e., their ability to differentiate between levels of semantic equivalence), and linguistic patterns in erroneous cases offer insights into the LLM{'}s capability and sensitivity. These findings could inform improvements in WiC task performance, although performance enhancement is not the primary focus of this study."

To test the zero-shot$^{\textrm{1}}$ performance of Flan-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5-turbo, we leverage challenging subsets from two equivalence matching datasets of the OAEI Bio-ML track, taking into account concept labels and structural contexts. Preliminary findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to outperform existing ontology alignment systems like BERTMap, given careful framework and prompt design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Investigating whether pre-trained language models (LMs) can function as knowledge bases (KBs) has raised wide research interests recently. However, existing works focus on simple, triple-based, relational KBs, but omit more sophisticated, logic-based, conceptualised KBs such as OWL ontologies. To investigate an LM's knowledge of ontologies, we propose OntoLAMA, a set of inference-based probing tasks and datasets from ontology subsumption axioms involving both atomic and complex concepts. We conduct extensive experiments on ontologies of different domains and scales, and our results demonstrate that LMs encode relatively less background knowledge of Subsumption Inference (SI) than traditional Natural Language Inference (NLI) but can improve on SI significantly when a small number of samples are given. We will open-source our code and datasets.},

For fine-tuning, we designed pairs of sentences in NL and the corresponding translations. This training pairs cover various aspects from ontology engineering: instances, class subsumption, domain and range of relations, object properties relationships, disjoint classes, complements, or cardinality restrictions. The resulted axioms are used to enrich an ontology, in a human supervised manner. The developed tool is publicly provided as a Protégé plugin.},

While existing research has primarily explored the utilisation of LLMs for constructing and completing semantic resources such as ontologies and knowledge graphs, the evaluation of these resources-addressing quality issues- has not yet been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-driven approach for the verification of ontology restrictions. We replicate our previously conducted human-in-the-loop experiment using ChatGPT-4 instead of human contributors to assess whether comparable ontology verification results can be obtained. We find that (1) ChatGPT-4 achieves intermediate-to-expert scores on an ontology modelling qualification test; (2) the model performs ontology restriction verification with accuracy of 92.22\%; (3) combining model answers on the same ontology axiom represented in different formalisms improves the accuracy to 96.67\%; and (4) higher accuracy is observed in identifying defects related to the incompleteness of ontology axioms compared to errors due to restrictions misuse. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting knowledge engineering tasks and outline future research directions in the area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Recently, LLMs' capability to store, retrieve and infer with symbolic knowledge has drawn a great deal of attention, showing their potential to understand structured information. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can understand Description Logic (DL) ontologies. In this work, we empirically analyze the LLMs' capability of understanding DL-Lite ontologies covering 6 representative tasks from syntactic and semantic aspects. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in understanding DL-Lite ontologies. We find that LLMs can understand formal syntax and model-theoretic semantics of concepts and roles. However, LLMs struggle with understanding TBox NI transitivity and handling ontologies with large ABoxes. We hope that our experiments and analyses provide more insights into LLMs and inspire to build more faithful knowledge engineering solutions.},

	abstract = {The continuous development in the medical field faces multiple challenges in managing a large amount of literature and research results using traditional ontology and knowledge graph construction methods. These challenges include high labor costs, limited coverage, and poor dynamism of traditional ontology and knowledge graph construction methods. Large language models (LLMs) can solve various natural language processing tasks and can understand and generate human-like natural language, which makes automated construction of ontology expansion and knowledge graphs (KGs) possible. This paper proposes an ontology expansion method based on LLMs, using LLMs to formulate competency questions (CQs) to extend the initial ontology, and then constructing the knowledge graph based on the extended ontology. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method by creating a knowledge graph for breast cancer treatment. The combination of LLMs-based medical ontology and knowledge graph can achieve more efficient medical knowledge management and application, promoting the informatization and intelligent development of the medical field.},
