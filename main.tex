The factors governing LLM-supported ontology population can be categorized
into two groups: Ontology factors and LLM factors. We provide an overview of
the relevant factors for each group, highlighting their relevance in
LLM-supported ontology population. Figure \ref{fig:variation-overview}
provides an overview of the factors of each group.

\subsection{Ontology Factors}
\label{subsec:ontology-factors}

Ontologies vary greatly depending on the complexities of the modeled domain
and the design choices taken by ontology engineers and domain experts
\citep{noy2001OntologyDevelopment101}. Our categorization of ontology factors
draws inspiration from the Ontology Learning Layer Cake
\citep{gangemi2005OntologyEvaluationValidation} with additional included
factors that are not captured by it.

\subsubsection{Scope:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-scope}

The scope of an ontology defines the level of specificity and abstraction of
its entities and its structural design. Ontologies can be \textbf{upper-level}
ontologies that define abstractions enabling integration of heterogeneous
knowledge across different domains
\citep{mascardi2007ComparisonUpperOntologies} or of a particular
\textbf{domain} itself e.g. the Gene Ontology (GO)
\cite{ashburner2000GeneOntologyTool} designed using the principles provided by
an upper ontology. The scope of ontologies test the semantic abilities of
LLMs. Upper ontologies challenge LLMs to understand abstractions effectively
requiring them to extract the ontological semantics of entities whereas domain
ontologies require LLMs to more directly apply their 'understanding' of
entities. The former requires LLMs to `take a step back' from the actual
content and recognize general patterns while the latter requires understanding
patterns based on the content itself.

\subsubsection{Metrics:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-metrics}

% Overall

\citet{hlomani2014ApproachesMethodsMetrics} highlight several
\textbf{structural} and \textbf{functional} metrics for evaluating
ontologies.
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural metrics evaluate the structural complexity of an ontology in
  terms of its size, breadth, depth and dispersion
  \citep{hlomani2014ApproachesMethodsMetrics}. The structure of an ontology
  highlights the semantics of the underlying domain or scope. The breadth and
  size of an ontology in terms of its entity count is an indicator of the
  vastness of its scope. Ontologies with large depth reflect domains with
  knowledge of high granularity while those with greater dispersion represent
  domains with several closely-related concepts (siblings). Structural nuances
  test the ability of LLMs to identify and populate domains of varying
  enormity and relational complexity.
\item Functional measures test the intended use of an ontology
  \citep{gangemi2005OntologyEvaluationValidation}. They evaluate the logical
  consistency and comprehensiveness of an ontology as a specification of a
  domain and its conceptualization. Measures likes completeness, conciseness,
  coverage and clarity \citep{hlomani2014ApproachesMethodsMetrics} indicate
  functional competency of an ontology in modelling its domain. While these
  measures are approximations of the effectiveness of the modelling of the
  domain, they can help highlight whether functional adequacy of an ontology
  influences the ability of an LLM to identify its assertions.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Entity Labels:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-entity-labels}

The naming of entites in an ontology is largely governed by conventions
followed in the domain of interest and by any upper ontologies used as
reference. Through their pre-training, LLMs exhibit impressive natural
language understanding and generation capabilities. The lexical semantics
learnt by LLMs are known to exhibit impressive performance on tasks of sense
distinction and semantic equivalence
\citep{hayashi2025EvaluatingLlmsCapability,petersen2023LexicalSemanticsWith}.
In terms of ontology population, LLMs are required to apply their lexical
sense of concept and individual labels to effectively identify
assertions. Variation in entity label naming highlights the parity between the
ontological semantics of the entities and the learnt lexical semantics of LLMs
for their labels. This parity is crucial for effective ontology population. As
most LLMs employ subword tokenization like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
\citep{sennrich2016NeuralMachineTranslation} for understanding prompts and
generating texts, evaluation over entity labels highlights whether LLMs are
able to effectively utilize lexical semantics or resort to more conventional
string edit-distance-based senses for performing ontology population.

\subsubsection{Taxonomy:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-taxonomy}

The taxonomy of an ontology is the pivotal backbone structure that defines the
hierarchy of concepts in a domain. While ontology population is concerned
primarily with identifying instances for concepts, it requires understanding
the granularity of the taxonomy to identify the correct concept for a new
individual assertion. Through LLM-supported ontology population, we can
investigate whether LLMs are capable of understanding the taxonomy of an
ontology and how new individuals are to be placed within that taxonomy.

\subsubsection{Non-hierarchical Relations:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-other-relations}

Apart from hierarchical relations, ontologies possess a wide variety of other
relations that describe other phenomena of a domain. Parthood, associative
relations and attribute relation properties comprise a large portion of
ontological relations. Such relations add complexity to the task of ontology
population, requiring care to avoid asserting new individuals with closely
related concepts e.g. asserting `Red' as an instance of the concept `Wine' in
the Wine Ontology \citep{noy2001OntologyDevelopment101} instead of an
attribute value of `WineColor' that is associated with different classes of
wine with the relation `hasColor'. Analysing whether LLMs are susceptible to
such pitfalls when populating ontologies can provide insight into their
ability to accurately apply a sense distinction in the context of ontologies.

\subsubsection{Attributes:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-attributes}

Closely related to non-hierarchical relations, attributes and properties pose
challenges of ontology sense distinction for LLMs enabling investigation of
their ability to distinguish attributes and data classes from core concepts of
the domain.

\subsubsection{Axioms:}
\label{subsubsec:ont-factor-axioms}

Axioms are the fundamental underlying principles that define the theory and
capabilities of an ontology. Axioms of logic, classes, individuals, properties
and classes define what is true in an ontology. They are logical
abstractions of the behaviour exhibited by the entities of an ontology in the
other layers of the Ontology Learning Layer Cake. While ontology population
itself does not strongly concern itself with the axioms of an ontology,
behaviour observed over the other factors observed for LLM-supported
ontology population provide indicators of the compliance of LLM-based
reasoning for ontology population with ontology axioms.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure}: Ontologies vary greatly in structure depending
on the complexity and requirements of the domain they model. Variation over
structural measures \cite{gangemi2005OntologyEvaluationValidation} such as
depth, breadth, dispersion, and tangledness enables understanding the
influence of each on LLM-supported ontology population. Analysis of the
relation between increasing complexity in terms of size, depth and breadth
with performance on ontology population will reveal whether LLMs struggle with
identifying individuals for more complex ontologies.
    
    \item \textbf{Entity Label Semantics and Lexical Similarity}: LLMs develop
a semantic sense of words and tokens as embeddings based on the number of
documents in their pre-training corpus
\cite{kandpal2023LargeLanguageModels}. This facilitates their ability to
provide sensible next-word predictions when generating responses. Ontology
population requires an LLM to correctly identify the asserted concept of an
individual using their labels' semantics. However, depending on the domain and
design decisions, ontologies can comprise of unrelated entities bearing
lexically similar labels. Therefore, LLM-supported ontology population
requires LLMs to distinguish between lexical and semantic similarity and
utilize semantic similarity to identify correctly asserted concepts. Assessing
the ability of LLMs to resort to semantic similarity versus lexical matching
highlights the reliability of LLMs to perform ontology
population. \chcomment[id=UB]{Rewrite paragraph}
